# MilTech VID Internship Submission
Project submission created for the MilTech [VID Full Stack internship position at Montana State University](https://virtualindustryday.org/internship.html)

[Hosted on Vercel](https://miltech-nextjs.now.sh)

## Built With
* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) React Framework
* [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com)
    - [Material-Table](https://material-table.com/)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io) Javascript Testing Framework
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org)

## Installation
To install the project:
 
```
npm install
``` 
 
 from the command line within the project directory.
 
 ## Starting the Server
 
 Build the project with:
 
 ```npm run build```
 
 Start the server with:
 
 ```npm run start```
 
 ## Running Test Suite
 
 Run the Jest test suite with:
 
 ```npm run test```
 
 ## Notes
 
 I wrote the sorting function to be able to sort the data by headers before I found the Material-Table component, which 
 included it's own sort. I left my sort function in the project to have a function that returned data for the test suite.
